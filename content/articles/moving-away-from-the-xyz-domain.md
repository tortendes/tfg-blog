If you see this blog post, you are most probably was told to when our websites are down. Here's why.

# Why is the furrygalaxy.XYZ down?

As you know or don't know, websites costs money. 
furrygalaxy.XYZ costed me $3 as far as I can remember.

Well too bad - it would cost me $12 to pay it for this year on September. That would cost me 574.27 Philippine pesos.

Mind that I'm only 13 and has limited access to money
Yeah - I cant afford that.

That's why we are now moving to new three domains

# The three horsemens, I mean domains

## What are these domains and what theyre supposed to do?

Well theres actually 4, we already depoyed it, but its not used much. (_spoiler alert, its [the url shortener](https://glxy.gq)_)

Here's the list: 
- https://furrygalaxy.gq - This would be the replacement domain of furrygalaxy xyz
- https://galaxian.ml - The special Minecraft server domain, for, well, our GalaxianMC.
- https://galaxian.gq - Our Galaxian Group website. Nothing much about it.

Anyways, thats the whole website, maybe we can have other sites soon, because 

***It's free real estate***

# Why the new domain just say this dumb and lame image

The reason why is that we are gonna use the new website - on the new domain. Because **it sounds right**.

You'll have a full functioning website when Galaxa 3 is out. It would require the website, trust me.

Anyways that would be it for this blog post, I hope you know why this is happening. Thank you!

# One last thing
